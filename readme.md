# NFL Data Exploration
Initial goal of this repository is to explore how NFL Combine data relates to NFL success.

## Installation

Required dependencies (currently):

- Python (>=3.4)
- Numpy
- Pandas
- BeautifulSoup

## Project Motivation

Discovering hidden correlations between statistics in various sports has always been interesting to me. I especially am interested in motivations of NFL front offices regarding QB draft picks. This project will perform a deep dive into understanding why certain players are picked and which drafting methods yield the highest success rate.

## Files

**explore_data.ipynb**: This file is currently being used to test webscraping and data wrangling methods to grab NFL data pertinent to investigating how combine stats relate to NFL performance. Eventually, when the data is properly wrangled, this notebook will perform EDA, generate visuals, and test models.
